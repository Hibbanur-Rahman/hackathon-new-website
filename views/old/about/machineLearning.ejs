                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Motion Tracking in Games</h5>

                    <p>Develop a motion tracking system in games, particularly in the context
                        of the metaverse. Engage technology and techniques used to capture and translate real-world
                        movements into the virtual environment. Implementation should enhance the user's experience
                        by
                        allowing their physical actions to be reflected in the digital space.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Auto Attendance</h5>

                    <p>Develop an auto attendance algorithm capturing attendance using Facial
                        Recognition. "Auto attendance" typically refers to automated systems or processes for
                        tracking
                        and recording attendance without manual intervention.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Timetable Scheduling</h5>

                    <p>Develop a Machine Learning algorithm to automate timetable scheduling.
                        Engage complex optimization problem that involves assigning resources (such as rooms,
                        teachers,
                        and time slots) to a set of events (such as classes, exams, or meetings) while satisfying
                        various constraints and objectives.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Detection of Disability using machine learning algorithms</h5>

                    <p> Develop a system to detect intellectual disabilities using machine learning based on visible
                        features, assessment test reports and results of the IQ tests by analysing and interpreting
                        visible and textual characteristics or traits to identify potential disabilities. The term
                        "disability" encompasses a wide range of conditions, and not all disabilities may be
                        identifiable solely through visible features.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Behaviour and Learning Analytics</h5>

                    <p>Develop algorithms to analyse Behaviour and learning
                        analytics. Incorporate behavior and learning analytics using machine learning leveraging
                        data
                        generated by users' actions and interactions in educational or behavioral settings to gain
                        insights, make predictions, and improve outcomes.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Nearest Clinical Psychologist + Psychiatrist Recommendation System
                    </h5>


                    <p>Develop an algorithm to
                        suggest the nearest and best Psychologist and psychiatrist of the area. Involves machine
                        learning and data-driven techniques to match individuals with appropriate psychologists and
                        psychiatrists based on their needs and preferences.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Test Recommender System</h5>

                    <p>Create a Test Recommender System based on the ailing conditions of the
                        patient. Disability test recommendation system can assist special educators, and general
                        services experts in using the test according to the age group, verbal and non-verbal nature.
                    </p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Education Plan Generator</h5>

                    <p>Create an algorithm to generate individual education plans using the
                        needs, abilities, level of understanding, and related topics for persons with intellectual
                        disabilities. Use optimization algorithms to finetune the education plans, tailor the plan
                        to
                        their needs.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: #7588fd">Context Based Translation</h5>

                    <p>Traditional machine translation systems often translate sentences
                        independently, which may lead to inaccuracies, especially in cases where the meaning of a
                        word
                        or phrase depends on the context. Develop a system that could overcome such inaccuracies and
                        increase the efficiency of the system.</p>
