                  <h5 class="themed-red">Code of Conduct</h5>
                  <p>
                    All participants are expected to adhere to the Code of
                    Conduct throughout the duration of the hackathon. This
                    includes maintaining respectful and professional conduct
                    towards fellow participants, organizers, mentors, and
                    judges. Any form of harassment, discrimination, or
                    disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants are also required to respect the intellectual
                    property rights of others, refrain from engaging in any form
                    of cheating or plagiarism, and comply with all local laws
                    and regulations. Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct
                    may result in disqualification from the event.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="themed-red">Intellectual Property</h5>
                  <p>
                    Participants retain ownership of the intellectual property
                    rights to the projects they develop during the hackathon. By
                    participating in the event, participants grant the
                    organizers a non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, and
                    distribute their projects for promotional and educational
                    purposes related to the hackathon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants are responsible for ensuring that their
                    projects do not infringe upon the intellectual property
                    rights of others. Any third-party materials used in the
                    projects must be properly attributed, and participants
                    should seek appropriate permissions or licenses for their
                    use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The organizers may provide guidance or resources on
                    intellectual property rights, but participants are
                    ultimately responsible for managing their own intellectual
                    property. The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any
                    project that violates intellectual property rights or
                    infringes upon the rights of others.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="themed-red">Team Formation</h5>
                  <p>
                    Teams must consist of 1 to 4 members. Participants are
                    responsible for forming their own teams within this size
                    limit. Each team member should be listed during
                    registration. Changes to team composition must be
                    communicated in advance. Teams exceeding the maximum size
                    may be disqualified.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="themed-red">Project Submission</h5>
                  <p>
                    All teams must submit their projects within the specified
                    deadline. Projects should be submitted through the
                    designated platform or method provided by the organizers.
                    Each submission must include all relevant files,
                    documentation, and any additional materials required for
                    evaluation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Projects should be original creations developed during the
                    hackathon, and any third-party resources used must be
                    properly attributed. Late submissions may not be accepted,
                    and teams are responsible for ensuring that their
                    submissions are complete and error-free. The organizers
                    reserve the right to disqualify projects that do not adhere
                    to the submission guidelines or violate any rules of the
                    hackathon.
